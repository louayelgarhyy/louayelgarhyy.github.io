    longDescription: `Bazar is a full-featured multi-vendor marketplace mobile application built with Flutter, Laravel and React.js. It reimagines online shopping by combining the functionality of a traditional e-commerce platform with modern social engagement features â€” offering users a seamless, interactive, and engaging experience.

    The app allows users to browse products from multiple vendors, place orders, and interact with content-rich reels showcasing products through both photos and videos. Users can follow their favorite vendors, like products and reels, and leave ratings and reviews to help others make informed decisions.
        
    Vendors can create profiles, list products with media-rich content, and engage directly with potential buyers through social-like features, making the selling experience more dynamic and personalized. Reels serve as a powerful marketing tool inside the app, where sellers can creatively promote their items.
        
    Push notifications are integrated using Firebase, ensuring users stay updated with order statuses, new product listings, promotional reels, and social activity. The backend is powered by a secure Laravel API, optimized behind Cloudflare for enhanced performance and protection.

    The UI is fast, responsive, and built for both Android and iOS using Flutter, offering a consistent experience across platforms.`,
